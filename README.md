# Enterprise IAM Federation Lab (AWS + IdP)

This repository documents a hands-on IAM federation setup I built step-by-step, including AWS configuration and Identity Provider (IdP) integration, with notes, troubleshooting, and security considerations.

## Goals
- Build and document an end-to-end federation flow into AWS (enterprise-style).
- Treat this as a reusable blueprint and study artifact for cloud architecture / security.

## What's inside
- `docs/` Step-by-step documentation (architecture, setup, flow, troubleshooting)
- `diagrams/` Architecture and sequence diagrams
- `notes/` Iteration log and changes

## Current status
- Phase 1: IAM + Federation foundation ✅ (in progress docs)
- Phase 2: Networking + Core AWS services (planned)
- Phase 3: Automation/IaC + Terraform (planned)

## Quick start
Start here: `docs/00-overview.md`
